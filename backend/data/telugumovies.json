In attempting to define themselves in a post feminist world, Cliff's sons struggle to come to terms with the roles they have played as brothers, sons and men. Alex, the troubled middle child, is in turmoil with the collapse of a long marriage and the subsequent battle for his children and a new identity. His elder brother Martin, a wild boy musician has eschewed his remarkable musical talent for a now dwindling pop fame. And Toby, their younger brother, the forgotten child, hides in the suburbs too frightened to accept that his ideal of a family will never be realized. When the war of words quietens, it is music which offers a respite and reconciles the brothers to the loss of a father they could never be good enough for.</p>",
